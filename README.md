# NBSE-Project

NSBE Hackathon 2020 - University of Toronto

Alongside three members, we've created a webapp called **Clarity** .
The purpose of this project is to help those on the spectrum in order for them to understand their emotions.
Today, there are many out there who do not have the benefit of understanding emotions, which is what we know of being a part of our identity.
It converts speech into an audiofile and analyzes the content in order to produce qualitative data such as "tone".
With that, we are able to provide data such as what type it is, what that tone means, and what kind of emotion it represents.

The webapp was created through CSS, HTML, JS as well as Python in order to produce what we have there.
The front end revolved around CSS, HTML, and JS, making it responsive and more easy to use with the target audience in mind.
Google and IBM APIs are then incorporated in order to produce the audio-file input as well as the analysis process.
After connecting the two APIs and linking the backend files to the frontend design, we then create what we have now.
